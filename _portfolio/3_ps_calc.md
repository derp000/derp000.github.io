Created a command-line application that allows users to find out their current or previous marking period QPA by automatically logging into PowerSchool and scraping site data. Documented code in Javadoc and in separate Markdown file. This one of the first projects I worked on as a freshman, and I was pretty happy with how it turned out! I kept working/tweaking it for about a year or so, like adding in a Java port of the API to practice for the AP CS A test :) The reason I started this project was because my school's grade system, PowerSchool, would not show my QPA, and it was annoying figuring out how to calculate the various quality points and credits I recieve from each class.

**Technologies:** Selenium, BeautifulSoup
