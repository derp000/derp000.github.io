Created a responsive mock space-tourism company website with interactive 3D components. Won 5<sup>th</sup> at the 2023 NJ TSA Competition. I had a lot of fun building this out and involved a lot of trial and error, especially with getting the interactive 3D globes to work! Through my research, I was also able to learn a lot about the aerospace industry. Although my partner did not know how to code, she was immensely knowledgeable and helpful in the aerospace field.

As I aluded to above, my favorite part was getting these Google-Earth-style globes to work, so that users could visualize the hypothetical landmarks they'd be able to visit on various planets.

*Main Attractions Page*

User chooses a planetary trip to preview.
