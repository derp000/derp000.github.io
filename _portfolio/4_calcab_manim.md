Created a 3D animation visualizing my AP Calculus AB final project. The objective was to determine the volume of a tent my teacher set up in his room. The tent had a square base and was held up by two curved metal rods. I apporximated the two curved rods as two parabolas perpendicular to each other on the z-axis. With this setup, I was able to integrate these square cross sections along the z-axis to find the volume. In the end, our predicted volume was a bit off since our parabola approximations were a bit idealistic, but I still enjoyed creating this solution and animating it!

Here's the presentation:

To explain what's going on in the animations, there are speaker notes in the Google Slide and in the [implementation script](https://github.com/derp000/calc-ab-final/blob/main/project/scene.py).
