Hi! I am a high school student from Union County Magnet High School. I am heavily interested in CS/CE and am involved with robotics, web development, and some ML research. I have also recently become more interested in biology, particularly in its intersection with the CS/CE field. Here you can learn a bit about me and check out my portfolio of projects! :)
